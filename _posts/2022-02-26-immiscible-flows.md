# Abstract:

In classification tasks, it is crucial to meaningfully exploit information contained in data. Here, we propose a physics-inspired dynamical system that adapts Optimal Transport principles to effectively leverage color distributions of images. Our dynamics regulates immiscible fluxes of colors traveling on a network built from images. Instead of aggregating colors together, it treats them as different commodities that interact with a shared capacity on edges. Our method outperforms competitor algorithms on image classification tasks in datasets where color information matters.
