I am a PhD student at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) in Tübingen (Germany), working with [Caterina De Bacco](https://www.cdebacco.com/), in the [Physics for Infrence and Optimization group](https://pio.is.mpg.de/person/cdebacco). Previously, I was a Master's student at [IMPA](https://impa.br/) (_in brazilian portuguese: Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada,_), in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), working with [Roberto Imbuzeiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=E5NCCUEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at the intersection of Graph Theory and Applied Probability. I have a degree in Mathematics, obtained at the ULA (_in spanish: Universidad de Los Andes_) in Mérida, Venezuela, where I am originally from.

I am a PhD at the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), affiliated to the [Cyber Valley](https://cyber-valley.de/), and to the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).

My research focuses on applying Optimal Transport methods to solve problems on networks. Some of my research interests include:
- Optimal Transport theory and applications
- Network-related problems, like community detection, link prediction, routing optimization
- Hypergraph theory and applications
- Probabilistic Machine Learning

You can find a list of my scientific works on the tab **"Publications"**.
