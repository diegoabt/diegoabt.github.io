I am a Postdoc/Software Engineer at Fariba Karimi's group, _[Network Inequality and Fairness](https://www.networkinequality.com)_, at TU Graz (Austria). I obtained my PhD at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/)
in Tübingen (Germany), under the supervision of [Caterina De Bacco](https://www.cdebacco.com/), in the [Physics for Inference and Optimization group](https://pio.is.mpg.de/person/cdebacco). 
I was part of the PhD at the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), affiliated to the [Cyber Valley](https://cyber-valley.de/), and to the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).

Previously, I was a Master's student at [IMPA](https://impa.br/) (_in brazilian portuguese: Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada,_), in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), working with [Roberto Imbuzeiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=E5NCCUEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at the intersection of Graph Theory and Applied Probability. I have a degree in Mathematics, obtained at the ULA (_in spanish: Universidad de Los Andes_) in Mérida, Venezuela, where I am originally from.

My research focuses on structural inequalities in networks and developing methods to mitigate these imbalances. Previously, I explored how Optimal Transport techniques can be applied to solve network-related problems.

**Research Interests:**

* Optimal Transport: theory and real-world applications
* Network science: community detection, link prediction, and routing optimization
* Hypergraph theory and its applications
* Probabilistic Machine Learning

You can find a list of my scientific works on the tab **"Publications"**.   

I'm deeply interested in finding creative ways to bridge the gap between complex research and public understanding. Whether through building intuitive software tools, engaging in science communication, or creating illustrative digital art, I aim to make scientific work more accessible and engaging to broader audiences.
